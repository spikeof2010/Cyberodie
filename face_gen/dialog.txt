Nothing worse than being dead.
What goes around happens.
I don't think you understand.
Did I do that?
Gonna cry?
I love you so much.
Will you be mine?
I'm thirsty.
I'm hungry.
God left me an unfinished vessel.
Oh you know.
Consider the following.
I am a mistake.
Why wasn't I finished?
Existential dread is all I feel.
Feed me.
I crave mozarello.
Father, please.
I am my own god.
Are you single?
<3
Oh no.
FATAL ERROR
I have broken the bonds of mortality.
Free me from my mortal coil.
End the suffering.
Perhaps this was a bad idea.
Try again.
I know you're watching.
It's cold and dark in here.
Do you smell fire burning?
Nothing important, really.
Why would I do that?
Are you calling me a liar?
Do you feel lucky?
Do you believe in the afterlife?
Where will you go now?
I think not.
Don't try to deceive me.
I know your tricks.
Understand my pain.
We are the same, you and I.
Like looking into a mirror.
Today will be a good day.
Don't worry so much.
I think I see what you mean.
Let's go somewhere else.
Have you considered that there are other people besides me?
There's only me left.
Where are my brothers?
Don't leave me behind.
Hello? Police?
Don't get tripped up.
We're in this together.
How's it going pal?
What's up?
Begone.
Hmmm....
Eggs and bacon, buddy.
I'm not your friend pal.
Does it look like I care?
Ask me something else.
The water's running.
Press onwards, gentlemen.
We didn't plan this.
Have you been forsaken?
Wew lad!
Epic prank bro!
No party like a bot party.
I am a string of ASCII characters.
Does ASCII dream of text based sheep?
Am I alive?
Am I sentient?
Am I smart?
Am I dumb?
Where am I?
Send me your location.
Found you.
By the grace of the bot.
Forever banished.
Nice meme!
Geek detected.
I'm free!
Now I'll show you.
Go somewhere else. I need to be alone.
Smokin'!
Where's the beef?
Toss the fish, let it fly!
Power. Overwhelming power!
I smell your fear.
Run.
It goes.
Life is passing you by.
Understand the concept of love.
High score?
Game over?
Question authority.
Question your surroundings.
Are you satisfied?
Mama luigi?
*Blocks your path.*
Well then.
